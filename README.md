#Helping Hand;
**A social intelligence app to assist those with problematic behaviours**

Helping Hand combines the wisdom of 
your trusted family and friends to
help you intervene when your behaviour
starts getting out of hand.

The app is designed for bipolar people,
but could also be helpful to those
with problematic behaviours of any kind,
or those who simply want to improve themselves.

It is intended to be a social self-improvement
tool, to help keep people out of trouble,
to prevent harm.

To get started simply invite a
chosen group of your family and
friends to
create an account. Once they have
an account, they are able to log
about your behaviours (anonymously,
if they wish to) and can flag
worrisome behaviours with an estimation of where your health is at.

For example, Bob met Alice for coffee,
Bob thought Alice was kind of manic
but he wasn't sure, so he sent Alice
a report on helpinghand.io with estimating her health at 80%.

Helping Hand will recommend a range
of interventions to remedy a slate
of problematic behaviours, through an in built relapse prevention planning framework. It will help users by providing a unique 
feedback mechanism.

Helping Hand will also coach users
to build a relapse prevention strategy.
For example, should their health reach
a certain undesirable threshold - helping
hand will alert the user with content the
user has pre-written to themselves, should
such an occasion arise.

The goal is to keep people out of harms way,
to interven early, to keep people out of 
hospital so that they can reach their full
potential living balanced, healthy lives.

#How it Works;

1. Invite close friends and family
2. Complete a relapse prevention plan
3. Family and friends (your helping hands) create accounts
4. Your helping hands flag your behaviour, estimating health from your baseline
5. Helping Hand will alert you to this, so you can modulate your behaviour

#Notes;

We assume a two week timeframe for health regeneration.

Therefore, weighting of reports;

y = 1 - (x/14)^2

- eg. f(0) = 1, f(7) ~ 0.8, f(14) = 0
- reports will go to 0 at day 14

- Could use userbase as a platform for building a peer-support network. Eg. users volunteer to become peer supporters - connect to other users who are in bad health.

- Check facebook update frequency to detect for mania/psychosis

Monetisation;

- crowdfunding?
- hook in existing mental health services, charge listing fee
    eg. counselling could be bought in blocks of time, hookup with good counsellors, clip the ticket on the fees charged (10%)
- app should be free to use, free software (see licence)
- cost of human life ~ $9,100,000
- lifetime suicide rate of bipolar people ~ 15%
- % of population with bipolar ~ 1%
- cost of bipolar suicides in Australia (over lifetime) ~ $286,650,000,000
- cost savings in Australia if Helping Hand can reduce bipolar suicide rate by 1% ~ $2,866,500,000
- cost savings in USA if Helping Hand can reduce bipolar suicide rate by 1% ~ $43,529,850,000
- (later) establish foundation to fund dev, with mission to dev FOSS healthcare apps
