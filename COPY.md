#Introduction;

Welcome to Helping Hand, an app designed to assist you with your behaviour by combining the feedback of your trusted family and friends, with a management plan you design for yourself.

Helping Hand can be useful for people with [bipolar, depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, drug addictions, anxiety, misc. behavioural issues] and aims to assist with early intervention in issues that can arise from these states. We want our users to reach their full potential living healthy, balanced lives.

#Helper Invite Sample;

Dear {name},

I am using Helping Hand to manage my {insert condition}. Check it out at helpinghand.io

Helping Hand combines the feedback of my trusted family and friends to keep me on track and intervene early when things go sour. I would love it if you could be one of my trusted helpers.

Very simply, all you have to do is create an account. If any of my behaviour starts to concern you flag it in the app (anonymously if you wish), with a degree of confidence (if you aren't sure).

Thank you,

{user's name}

#Primary Carer Invite Sample;

Dear {name},

I am using Helping Hand to manage my {insert condition}. Check it out at helpinghand.io

Helping Hand combines the feedback of my trusted family and friends to keep me on track and intervene early when things go sour. I would love it if you could be one of my trusted carers.

Very simply, all you have to do is create an account. If any of my behaviour starts to concern you; flag it in the app (anonymously if you wish), with a degree of confidence (if you aren't sure).

As a primary carer, you will also be able to see reports made by others - to help you keep track of my well-being.

Thank you,
