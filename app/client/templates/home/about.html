    Helping Hand is made by a bunch of hackers who are hopefull that our social and emotional well-being can be improved with the help of our trusted family and friends. Often times when we experience poor social or emotional well-being, it can be hard to percieve it and to take neccasary steps to improve our well-being. We'll consider this project a success even if we help just one person.
